        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>1 large Vidalia or other sweet onion</li>
                <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <ol>
                <li>Slice onion into 1/4-inch-thick rings.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place a wire rack over a sheet of
                    aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Prepare breading station by setting out 3 wide, shallow dishes. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt
                    together in the first dish. Whisk milk and egg together in the second dish. Place bread crumbs in
                    the third dish.</li>
                <li>Dip each onion ring into the flour mixture, turning several times until fully coated with flour.
                    Transfer to the egg mixture and use a fork to turn until coated. Lift onion with the fork and shake
                    gently so excess liquid drips back into the dish. Place onion in the bread crumbs and turn several
                    times to coat, scooping crumbs over the ring if necessary. Lift again with the fork, tap any excess
                    bread crumbs back into the dish, and place on the wire rack while you prepare the remaining onion
                    rings.</li>
                <li>Deep-fry 3 to 4 onion rings at a time in the preheated oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain
                    on paper towels while you deep-fry the remaining rings.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with seasoning salt before serving.</li>
            </ol>
